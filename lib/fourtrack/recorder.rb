# A class used as a destination for periodically writing out batch-written
# JSON formattable payloads. Can be used for stats logs, SQL replay logs and the like.
# Is thread safe and uses gzip compression. Writes are performed using a binary UNIX
# append, which with a small-ish record size should guarantee atomic append.
